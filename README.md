# Project 1 - *Flixster*

**Flixster** shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **scroll through current movies** from the Movie Database API
* [X] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
* [X] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  * [X] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
  * [X] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)
* [X] Allow user to view details of the movie including ratings within a separate activity

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

* [X] Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
* [ ] Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using [Glide transformations](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#transformations)
* [ ] Apply the popular [View Binding annotation library](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-ViewBinding) to reduce boilerplate code.
* [ ] Allow video trailers to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView from the details screen.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

A challenge I encountered while building the app was that I initially could not get movie data when using the TMDB API. I later realized that it was because I was not properly storing the data recieved by the API, and was thus able to fix the issue.
